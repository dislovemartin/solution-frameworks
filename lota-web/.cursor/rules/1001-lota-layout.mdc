# LOTA Website Layout Standards

## Context
- This rule applies to all page layouts and section components in the LOTA website
- Ensures consistent section spacing, container usage, and responsive design
- Maintains the visual identity of the LOTA brand across the site

## Requirements

### Page Structure
- Use semantic `section` elements for major content blocks
- Apply consistent vertical spacing with `py-24` class for standard sections
- Use `container-wide` class for content containers
- Follow established grid patterns with responsive column counts
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 for page title, h2 for sections, h3 for subsections)

### Section Patterns
- Hero Section: Full-width with overlay text and background image
- Content Section: Standard padded section with appropriate container
- Alternate Sections: Alternate background colors (light/secondary) between sections
- Card Grids: Consistent grid layouts for cards and list items

### Responsive Layouts
- Use mobile-first approach with responsive class variants
- Standard grid patterns:
  - 1 column on mobile
  - 2 columns on medium screens (md:grid-cols-2)
  - 3 columns on large screens (lg:grid-cols-3)
- Maintain proper text hierarchy across breakpoints
- Adjust spacing proportionally across breakpoints

### Navigation & Footer
- Consistent header implementation across pages
- Standardized footer with proper sections and links
- Implement breadcrumbs on nested pages

## Examples

<example>
// Good section implementation
<section className="py-24">
  <div className="container-wide">
    <div className="max-w-xl mb-16">
      <h2 className="mb-6">Our Programs</h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Comprehensive development opportunities designed to nurture leadership skills, 
        professional growth, and community engagement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
      {/* Cards go here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Poor section implementation
<div>
  <h2>Our Programs</h2>
  <p>Program description</p>
  <div>
    {/* Cards without proper grid structure */}
  </div>
</div>
